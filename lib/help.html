<p><b>Style Adjuster</b> is a utility for selecting a set of properties within the CSS rules
that apply to a web page, making changes to those rules, and seeing
the results immediately in the browser.</p>

<h2>Tab: Style Sheets</h2>

<p>The <b>Style Sheets</b> tab shows all the CSS style sheets loaded into the web page
so that you can select those style sheets containing the rules that you want to edit.
Depending on how Style Adjuster has been injected into the page, some style
sheets may have been pre-selected.
</p>

<p>When a style sheet is deselected, any selections and changes for that style sheet
are not shown in the <b>Rules</b>, <b>Edit</b> or <b>Changes</b> tabs. However they are not discarded,
and will reappear if the style sheet is reselected.</p>

<h2>Tab: Rules</h2>

<p>The <b>Rules</b> tab shows all rules from the selected style sheets. Each rule can
be expanded to view and select the properties that you want to edit.
(Actual editing happens in the <b>Edit</b> tab.)</p>

<p>To edit properties, you must select the individual properties that you want to edit. 
Selecting a property forces the rule to be selected. Conversely, deselecting a rule deselects
all properties within the rule.</p>

<p>You can use the Filter field to view only a subset of rules. Rules are shown if the selector
matches part of the filter value, or, if the rule is already selected.</p>

<p>There is a checkbox option to only show selected rules, and buttons to expand or unexpand
all currently visible rules.</p>

<h2>Tab: Edit</h2>

<p>The <b>Edit</b> tab shows all the properties selected in the <b>Rules</b> tab.</p>

<p>Clicking on a property invokes the property editor for that rule.</p>

<p>The property editor includes a text field for editing the value directly.</p>

<p>You can enter a new value in the text field, and then either press "Save" or
press the "Enter" key.</p>

<p>If the entered value is invalid for the CSS property, it will not be saved, and
an error message will be displayed.</p>

<p>You can clear any unsaved changes and error messages by clicking on the property again.</p>

<p>The "Reset" button will reset the value of the property back to its original value.</p>

<p>When a property value is set to a value different to its original value, the changed
value is highlighted, the original value is also displayed in italics, and that property
cannot be deselected.</p>

<p>For some properties, additional UI is provided for changing the property value, for example
using sliders to change numerical values.</p>

<p>Currently, additional editing UI is provided for the following CSS properties:</p>

<table class="property-editors">
<thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Value type</th></tr></thead>
<tbody id="property-editors-list"></tbody>
</table>

<h2>Tab: Changes</h2>

<p>The <b>Changes</b> tab shows the current changes made in CSS format. This can be selected
using the "Select" button, and copied and pasted into a file. (It is up to you how you reintegrate
any changes made into your source files. However, the changes can simply be inserted as-is to the end
of the last CSS file included in the web page, or saved to a new CSS file which is included
as the last CSS file in the web page, and they will be correctly applied to the web page.)</p>

<h2>Keyboard Shortcut</h2>

<p><b>Ctrl-Alt-F12</b> hides and re-displays the Style Adjuster dialog.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p><b>Style Adjuster</b> is work-in-progress. It has enough functionality to be useful, but
more is needed.</p>

<p>Known limitations include:</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>Style Adjuster</b> does not work on a touch screen (that is, a mouse is required).</li>
 <li>The rules filter only filters on exact sub-strings. An option to filter on whole words would
be useful, especially when searching for tags like <b>"a"</b> and <b>"p"</b>.</li>
 <li>Special editing UI is only defined for some CSS property types.</li>
 <li>Special editing UI is only defined for those properties listed above.</li>
 <li>For some of the properties with special editing UI, the UI only works for a subset of possible property
values. For example, <b>border-color</b> only has special editing UI when the value is a single color.</li>
 <li>Compound "shorthand" properties, such as <b>font</b> and <b>border</b>, do not yet 
have a special editing UI (even though some of their component properties do).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Browser Issues</h2>

<p><b>Style Adjuster</b> depends on the browser's representation of CSS styles for a page in the 
<b>document.styleSheets</b> object. It reads the CSS style information from that object, and it also
updates changed styles into the same object.</p>

<p>Unfortunately browser implementations can choose to store CSS data in <b>document.styleSheets</b> slightly
differently to how it appears in the source CSS file, which somewhat undermines attempts to use it as a 
mechanism for editing styles in-page.</p>

<p>There are three different changes that I have observed to occur:</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>Joining</b>, where multiple properties such as <b>border-style</b>, <b>border-color</b> and
<b>border-width</b> get aggregated into "shorthand" properties such as <b>border</b>.</li>
 <li><b>Splitting</b>, for example where <b>border</b> gets split into 
<b>border-top-style</b>, <b>border-right-style</b>, <b>border-bottom-style</b>, <b>border-left-style</b>, <b>border-top-width</b>, <b>border-right-width</b>, <b>border-bottom-width</b>, <b>border-left-width</b>, <b>border-top-color</b>, <b>border-right-color</b>, <b>border-bottom-color</b> and <b>border-left-color</b> (or more, depending on what values were included in the property value).
</li>
 <li><b>Format changes</b>, where a property value in one format, such as an <b>HSL</b> color, gets
converted into <b>RGB</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For examples which cause some browsers to either join or split properties in the same CSS rule, see the 
"box" classes on <a href="box-examples.html">this page</a>.</p>

<p><b>Style Adjuster</b> mitigates some format changes when editing, by remembering the input format,
and reconverting any converted data back into the same input format (or, if that can not be done 
precisely, it retains the input value).</p>

<p>For the moment, if you want to edit the original property values without them being joined or split,
you have to choose a browser that doesn't join or split respectively.
</p>

<p>Currently observed browser behaviour, on the latest browser versions, is as follows:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>Behaviour</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Firefox 23 (Windows &amp; Linux)</td><td>(no changes)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Internet Explorer 10</td><td>Joins</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chrome 28 (Windows &amp; Linux)</td><td>Joins</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chromium 28 (Linux)</td><td>Joins</td></tr>
<tr><td>Opera 12 (Windows)</td><td>Splits</td></tr>
<tr><td>Safari 5.1.7 (Windows)</td><td>Splits</td></tr>
</tbody>

<h3>File URL Cross-Origin Issues</h3>

<p><b>Chrome</b> and <b>Chromium</b> do not allow access to <b>document.styleSheets</b> information
for <b>file:</b> URLs, and will not load the <b>help.html</b> file (which you are reading now),
unless the <b>--allow-file-access-from-files</b> flag is used.</p>

<p><b>Opera</b> will not load the <b>help.html</b> file from a <b>file:</b> URL.</p>

<h3>Other Browser Issues</h3>

<p><b>Internet Explorer 9</b> unexpectedly closes the Style Adjuster dialog whenever <b>Enter</b> is entered
into a text field.</p>
