<p><b>Style Adjuster</b> is a utility for selecting a set of properties within the CSS rules
that apply to a web page, making changes to those rules, and seeing
the results immediately in the browser.</p>

<h2>Tab: Style Sheets</h2>

<p>The <b>Style Sheets</b> tab shows all the CSS style sheets loaded into the web page
so that you can select those style sheets containing the rules that you want to edit.
Depending on how Style Adjuster has been injected into the page, some style
sheets may have been pre-selected.
</p>

<p>When a style sheet is deselected, any selections and changes for that style sheet
are not shown in the <b>Rules</b>, <b>Edit</b> or <b>Changes</b> tabs. However they are not discarded,
and will reappear if the style sheet is reselected.</p>

<h2>Tab: Rules</h2>

<p>The <b>Rules</b> tab shows all rules from the selected style sheets. Each rule can
be expanded to view and select the properties that you want to edit.
(Actual editing happens in the <b>Edit</b> tab.)</p>

<p>To edit properties, you must select the individual properties that you want to edit. 
Selecting a property forces the rule to be selected. Conversely, deselecting a rule deselects
all properties within the rule.</p>

<p>You can use the Filter field to view only a subset of rules. Rules are shown if the selector
matches part of the filter value, or, if the rule is already selected.</p>

<p>There is a checkbox option to only show selected rules, and buttons to expand or unexpand
all currently visible rules.</p>

<h2>Tab: Edit</h2>

<p>The <b>Edit</b> tab shows all the properties selected in the <b>Rules</b> tab.</p>

<p>Clicking on a property invokes the property editor for that rule.</p>

<p>Currently the property editor for all rules is a simple text editor.</p>

<p>You can enter a new value in the text field, and then either press "Save" or
press the "Enter" key.</p>

<p>If the entered value is invalid for the CSS property, it will not be saved, and
an error message will be displayed.</p>

<p>You can clear any unsaved changes and error messages by clicking on the property again.</p>

<p>The "Reset" button will reset the value of the property back to its original value.</p>

<p>When a property value is set to a value different to its original value, the changed
value is highlighted, the original value is also displayed in italics, and that property
cannot be deselected.</p>

<h2>Tab: Changes</h2>

<p>The <b>Changes</b> tab shows the current changes made in CSS format. This can be selected
using the "Select" button, and copied and pasted into a file. (It is up to you how you reintegrate
any changes made into your source files. However, the changes can simply be inserted as-is to the end
of the last CSS file included in the web page, or saved to a new CSS file which is included
as the last CSS file in the web page, and they will be correctly applied to the web page.)</p>

<h2>Keyboard Shortcut</h2>

<p><b>Ctrl-Alt-F12</b> hides and re-displays the Style Adjuster dialog.</p>
