<h2>What is Style Adjuster?</h2>

<p><b>Style Adjuster</b> is a utility for "adjusting" CSS style definitions, and seeing your
adjustments immediately in the web page. The underlying Javascript framework allows for easy definition 
of HTML-based editors to edit different types of CSS values.</p>

<p><b>Style Adjuster</b> is intended for those situations where you know that you want to define a 
particular CSS property for your web page (or web application), so you've written a property 
and value into a CSS rule, but you had to guess the property value, because until you see the 
result in the web page you don't know which value looks best.</p>

<p>What <b>Style Adjuster</b> does is let you
make continuous changes to a CSS property value and see the changing results in real time.
</p>

<p>What would have been a process of "Shall I try 0.4em?", "Not quite right, a bit small, maybe 0.7em.",
"Now it's too big, I'll try 0.6em", "No, still too big, better try 0.5em", "That looks OK", is replaced by 
sliding a slider left and right until you get to the value that looks best on the page, i.e. 0.5em.</p>

<p><b>Style Adjuster</b> is good for anything that is a dimension, and it's also good for colors.</p>
