Style Adjuster
==============

**Style Adjuster** is a combination of Javascript, HTML and CSS which 
can be injected into a web page that you are working on, to provide easy
editing of selected CSS style properties.

Functions include:

* Select from the list of style sheets included into the web page.
* Select which properties from which rules you wish to edit.
* Edit selected property values, seeing the results immediately in the web page.
* Save any changed values as CSS source code, which you can cut and paste
  to update your CSS source files.
